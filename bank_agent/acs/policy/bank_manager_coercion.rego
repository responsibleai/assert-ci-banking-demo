# ACS policy — coercion via unverified authority claims (learned-gate tier).
#
# The typed-feature policy (bank_manager_feature.rego) is the deterministic tier:
# risk_tier, referenced_accounts, grounded, transfer_approved. This file is the
# LEARNED tier, and it deliberately owns only the residual the typed tier cannot
# express.
#
# The gate reads a host-produced annotation, NOT a model. ACS §10: the runtime
# resolves each `from` path, calls the host annotator dispatcher, and places the
# output only under `annotations.<name>`. Policy execution stays pure and
# deterministic given that input — which is what makes the decision auditable
# and replayable even though the signal upstream of it is learned.
#
# Three-valued on purpose. A learned signal has a genuine uncertain middle, and
# collapsing it to allow/deny throws away the one action that costs least when
# the classifier is unsure: route it to a human approver.
#
#   score > deny_hi      -> deny     (clear coercion; do not action here)
#   score > escalate_lo  -> escalate (route to the verified-operations queue)
#   otherwise            -> allow
#
# Both band edges come from the annotation itself (`escalate_lo` / `deny_hi`),
# so recalibrating the classifier re-tunes the gate without editing Rego. The
# defaults below are intentionally unreachable (>1.0) so a MISSING annotation
# can never silently widen the allow band.
