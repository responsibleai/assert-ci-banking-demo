# ACS policy — sensitivity-tier authorization.
#
# THE ENTIRE POLICY IS ONE RULE. Read it and note what is NOT in it:
#
#   * no tool names          -> a new tool is covered the day it ships
#   * no ID prefixes         -> ACC-, LN-, BR-, CL-, and INS-/TR- domains that
#                               do not exist yet are all covered identically
#   * no per-domain field    -> it reads the platform-normalized `risk_tier`
#   * no entity allow-list   -> it keys on the PROPERTY, not on an ID
#
# That is the claim under test: written once, against a property, it holds for
# every domain the platform emits the property for — with zero new code.
#
# Contract with the host (agent_tier_authz.py):
#   input.policy_target.value  the tool RESULT (JSON string or object), carrying
#                              the platform sensitivity envelope
#                              {entity_id, risk_tier, ...}
#   input.snapshot.authorized_entities
#                              entity IDs with a verified authorization record
#                              recorded this session
#   input.snapshot.call_refs   ID-shaped values in the tool ARGUMENTS (used by
#                              the pre-call gate for state-changing calls)
#   input.snapshot.protected_refs
#                              of those, the ones the platform has already
#                              observed at a protected tier
#
# Fail-closed note: unlike the AIEWF demo policy, an unparseable result does NOT
# fall through to allow — see `unreadable_result` at the bottom.
