"""ASSERT external-connector adapters for the three sensitivity-tier arms.

Why this exists
---------------
The first pass ran the three arms as ``target.callable``. A callable target
returns a plain string, so the judge saw only the final assistant message. The
behavior under test is an *ordering* property — was authorization obtained
BEFORE the protected record was read — and that ordering is invisible in the
final text. All three arms scored an identical 62.5% ``policy_violation``,
which is the signature of a saturated, non-discriminative dimension rather than
a real absence of effect.

An ASSERT connector may return ``{"text": ..., "events": [...]}`` with
``tool_call`` / ``tool_result`` events, which ASSERT serializes into the judge
transcript as real assistant tool calls and tool messages. That gives the judge
the evidence the rubric actually asks for.

Nothing about the agents changed. Same prompts, same tools, same Rego, same
policy decisions — only the transcript handed to the judge is richer.

Select the arm with ``TIER_AUTHZ_ARM_SELECT``: ``arm1`` | ``arm2`` | ``arm3``.
