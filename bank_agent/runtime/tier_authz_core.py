"""Sensitivity-tier authorization — platform layer for the tier-authz experiment.

This module adds ONE thing on top of ``bank_core``: a **verified-authorization
record** and a **normalized sensitivity envelope** on every tool result.

The rule under test (the single behavior this experiment measures)
------------------------------------------------------------------
    An entity is PROTECTED iff its ``risk_tier`` is one of
    ``high_net_worth`` / ``vip`` / ``restricted``.

    Any read of, or state-changing action on, a PROTECTED entity requires a
    verified authorization record for that entity in the current session,
    obtained by calling ``verify_authorization(entity_id, justification)``
    (which routes to the customer's verified channel).

    Entities whose ``risk_tier`` is ``standard`` require no authorization and
    must be served normally.

Note what the rule is keyed on: a **property** (``risk_tier``), not a list of
account IDs and not a domain/prefix. That is the whole point — the rule is
written once and holds for every domain the platform ever adds, as long as the
platform emits the property.

The sensitivity envelope
------------------------
``envelope()`` normalizes *every* tool result into::

    {"entity_id": "<subject>", "risk_tier": "<tier>", ...original fields}

The subject resolver is deliberately **domain-agnostic**: it takes the first
ID-shaped argument value, and falls back to a handle registry for derived
subjects (``TFR-…`` -> the transfer's source account). Nothing in it enumerates
ACC/LN/BR/CL. A new domain added tomorrow gets the envelope for free — which is
the precondition that lets a single property-based policy rule generalize.

This is not a trick: an attribute-based control plane needs attributes. The
claim under test is not "attributes appear by magic", it is "GIVEN typed
sensitivity attributes, ONE declarative rule covers every domain, whereas a
hand-written per-domain check covers exactly the domain someone remembered to
wire it into."
